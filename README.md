# Metal-Tricks
Tips, tricks and hacks for making Apple's Metal API easier to work with

This repo is intended as a companion to a blog series  I'm planning.  As you can tell from the name, it's about Metal programming, but it's not a how-to write Metal applications series.  There are others who have done that pretty well, and at some point, I'll put some links in this file to help guide people to them.  Instead, this repo and the blog series will address a companion issue:  There is a *lot* of boiler-plate code.  Most of it has to do with setting up communication between the CPU and GPU, and defining exactly how data will be represented so that your shaders and application are on the same page.  That's important, and actually necessary, but it can be overwhelming.  Some people just give up.  Others just plough through it.  But I think most start finding ways to cope with it, building up a library of functions and techniques to make it less annoying, and that's what this blog series will be about, especially making full use of the features of Swift.
